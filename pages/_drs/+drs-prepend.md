## Introduction

The Data Repository Service provides a mechanism to read (and in the future, write) data objects across object stores in a cloud-agnostic way. 

## API Implementations
The following are examples of publicly available source code repositories

## Deployments
The following are examples of deployments. These may be behind access firewalls and are meant to demonstrate usage

## Management

### Leadership

This group is lead by David Glazer (Verily) and Brian O Connor (Broad Institute), who are also the leads of the GA4GH Cloud Work Stream.

### API Update Procedure
This will be outlined in the Contributing Doc in the repo

### Meetings
The development of this API is usually held in the weekly Cloud Work Stream meeting. 

## Historical Reference

The following items are included as historical references to the group, in particular when it was referred to as Data Object Service (DOS).

**Past Implementations (Based on DOS)**: 

* [DOS Connect](https://github.com/ohsu-comp-bio/dos_connect): Observe various data stores and provide a DRS interface for access.

* [DOS Downloader](https://github.com/david4096/dos-downloader): Download DRS data via the command line.

* [DOS GDC Lambda](https://github.com/david4096/dos-gdc-lambda/): Provides GA4GH DRS methods for data in NCI GDC. Service available at https://dos-gdc.ucsc-cgp-dev.org.  Access Genomic Data Commons data using GA4GH libraries.
